# It Takes A Village

## Purpose
The idea behind our project, "It takes a village," is to help people collaborate on everyday tasks. It may particularly focus on families with small children but will be applicable to a much broader audience. We aim to steer away from individualism and instead facilitate activities such as communal cooking, childcare, playdates, item-sharing pools including tools, joint ownership of seldom-used items, and much more. Our goal is that this approach could also contribute to environmental efforts by cooking together, sharing tools and items, and reducing overall consumption.
